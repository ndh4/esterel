#|

When starting an `esterel`, we create a new thread that has
the state of all the emitted signals, the `instant loop` thread.
Then we also put the argument to `esterel` in its own thread,
and all of the operations (emit, pause, etc) all communicate
with the instant loop thread to determine the value of signals
and to set them.

Each time we do a `with-trap` we bind the variable to a new
trap value and store, in that value, a natural number. This number
is the depth of the trap that was just created and is stored
in a continuation mark (with-trap's body is not in tail position
wrt to the trap in order to avoid these marks colliding with each
other). We also stick an escape continuation into the trap
value. When exiting to a trap (that is not inside a nested par)
we just jump to the escape continuation in the trap.

Each `par` creates N different racket threads, one for each
argument of the par. These threads all have a continuation
mark set at the start with the trap counter at the par, which
is used to determine if a trap is going to cross the par when
it is exited. If a trap does have to exit the par, we communicate
with the instant thread to let it know that this arm of the par
has finished. When all arms of the par finish, then we decide
what to do with the par. This is handled by `maybe-finalize-a-par`
(which also uses `unpause-to-trap`).

To handle instantaneous reaction to absence, we block on
unemitted signals. When all threads are blocked, then we know
that we cannot make progress in "must" mode (ie normal execution
of the program), so we switch to "can" mode. We remember where
we are by grabbing continuations for all the threads and then
start exploring to see which signals can be emitted. To explore,
we systematically consider all possible signal settings (ie explore
2^n ways to continue from this point if there are n signals that
the computation is blocked on) and record which signals were
emitted. Any signal that doesn't get emitted during this process
cannot be emitted, so we set it to absent (and continue the
computation, back in "must" mode from where we saved all the
continuations).

There is a subtle point with "dynamically created" signals. That is,
when a signal is created during a "can" exploration, it might be
important that we detect it was not emitted in order to make
progress in the computation. So the question is how do we know
if this signal is the "same" signal for other can exploration
or for must execution? The way we do this is to collect the source
location of the signal when it is created and pair that with a
counter that is specific to the instant where it is being
used. Then, we can reset the counter back to the same
value for can explorations and subsequent must evaluation.
